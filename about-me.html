            <p>William Glass was born in London, on November 28, 1957. Son of Arthur Glass and Charlotte Cuthbert, the young William has discovered the art of phoography at the age of 14 when his grandfather Vincent Glass gifted him with his first analog camera on his birthday.</p>
            <p>Since then, William has captured a large variety of subjects on his lenses, starting with portraits of his family members in its daily life. In 1987, the recently graduated William and his beloved fianc√©e at the time, Anne, went on a journey around the world. Unfortunately, Anne has passed away during that trip and since then the widowed Glass has dedicated himself to charity work, constantly learning and developing new skills and points of view in photography.</p>
            <p>Now, most of his works focus on minimalism. His preferred subject matter is the daily activity of those who are conscious and self-aware of their own finitude. That way, Glass' eyes and lenses are always looking forward to capture in a frame a moment of Eternity in the memory of Anne.</p>
